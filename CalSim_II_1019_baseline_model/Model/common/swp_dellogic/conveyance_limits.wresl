/*

Both pumping plant unit outages and aqueduct restrictions place conveyance
limits to the ability to move water through the State Water Project facilities.

Unit outages, both scheduled or unscheduled, come from historical 2001-2006 monthly
outage reports.

Source of data: DWR SWP-OCO; Tuan Bui and Tio Zasso were consulted in Feb 2007;
based on reports provided by Dick Oravetz.
