!Step 1: Determine SWP allocation (use either WSI-DI or CAM):
  !Option 1a - WSI-DI Procedure:
INCLUDE 'wsi_di\wsi_swp.wresl'
INCLUDE 'wsi_di\di_swp.wresl'
INCLUDE 'wsi_di\export_index_swp.wresl'
INCLUDE 'wsi_di\exp_based_del_swp_s.wresl'
INCLUDE 'wsi_di\delcar_swp.wresl'
  !Option 1b - CAM Procedure (note - must also include CAM cycle in main file):
!INCLUDE 'allocation\swp_allocation.wresl'

!Step 2: Define delivery parameters for each contractor:
INCLUDE 'demands\swp_arcsplit.wresl'!*
INCLUDE 'demands\swp_demands_s.wresl'!*

!Step 3: Keep a running account of actual deliveries made to each contractor
INCLUDE 'deliveries\sumswpdel.wresl'!*
INCLUDE 'deliveries\swp_delivery_summary.wresl'!*

!Step 4: Distribute SWP allocation to each contractor:
INCLUDE 'allocation\swp_contractor_perdel_A.wresl'
INCLUDE 'allocation\carryover_allocation.wresl'
INCLUDE 'allocation\swp_contractor_perdel_B.wresl'
INCLUDE 'allocation\swp_feather_perdel.wresl'
INCLUDE 'deliveries\swp_bound_del.wresl'

!Misc. code related to SWP facilities:
  !Seismic concerns have reduced maximum operating capacity at Lake Perris to 74 TAF:
goal PerrisSeismic {S27 < 74.}
  !Pumping capacity is not 100% reliable; must take unit outages into account:
INCLUDE 'conveyance_limits.wresl'
