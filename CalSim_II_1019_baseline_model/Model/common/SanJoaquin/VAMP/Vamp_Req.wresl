! WRESL code defining the VAMP pulse flow requirement.

/*
 The code computes the required Vernalis flow during the pulse period.

 These are the defines and goals for cycle 5, which calculates and implements the VAMP requirement
 for the pulse period (April 15 - May 15).  The VAMP requirement is computed from a step-function
 look-up table based on the base or pre-existing flow (from the previous cycle) and water year type.
 The deficiencies are imposed on the following San Joaquin River Group Authority as reservoir
 releases and/or reductions in demands (in "VAMPalloc.wresl"):
    1)  Merced ID (McClure)
    2)  Oakdale Irrigation district (New Melones)
    3)  Mendota Pool Exchange Contractors (DMC)
    4)  Modesto and Turlock ID (Don Pedro)

 The following is the table
 VAMP_REQ
 Base    requirement DoubleStep
 0      2000        3200
 1999   2000        3200
 3199   3200        4450
 4449   4450        5700
 5699   5700        7000
 99999  7000        7000

 Current plus last year's water year type (wyt_SJR_prv1) used in
 determining if double step applies.
 Current plus last two year's water year type (wyt_SJR_prv2) used in
 determining if dry year relaxation applies.

 VAMP flow requirement:
 April triggers a pulse flow for the VAMP requirement.
 In April during wet years a increase in the requirement or "Double step" is activated.
 Reciprically, during sequential dry years a requirement relaxation is allowed (no requirement).
 In "normal" years the requirement is based cycle 4 (SJR_WQ2) inflows from the San Joaquin River
 to the Delta.
 May will assume the April value.
 All other months do not require a VAMP pulse flow requirement.
