! The following code reallocates purchased water from OID to various in-stream needs.

/*
 The following code makes releases from New Melones to augment Stanislaus flows
 by the amounts purchased from OID.
 October - the amount is an even 15 TAF
 November and December - the amount is any remaining from the 11 TAF that OID
 reserves every year to sell for VAMP and other instream flows.  In the event
 that the entire 11 TAF was not used in April and May for VAMP, the balance is
 split between November and December.
