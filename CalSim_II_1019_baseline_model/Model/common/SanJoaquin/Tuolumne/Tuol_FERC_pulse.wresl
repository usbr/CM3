! Calculates the FERC pulse flows on the Tuolumne River

/*
The FERC pulse flows are read as timeseries inputs based on pre-processed
hydrology. In April and May, a FERC pulse flow requirement is calculated,
but the pulse flow only applies during the last 16 days in April and the
first 15 days in May. According to documentation, to ensure a minimum
throughout the Tuolumne River, it is necessary to impose this
requirement on reaches C540, C542, and C544. However, in this code the
requirement is not imposed on C542 and C544.  Why?????????????
