! This code calculates the FERC minimum flows on the Tuolumne River


/*
The FERC minimum flows are read as timeseries inputs based on pre-processed
hydrology. According to documentation, to ensure a minimum through
throughout the Tuolumne River, it is necessary to impose this requirement on
reaches C540, C542, and C544. However, in this code the requirement is not
imposed on C542 and C544.  Why?????????????
