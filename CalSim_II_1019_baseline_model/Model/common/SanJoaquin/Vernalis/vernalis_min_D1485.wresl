! Originally coded by Edward Chang (DWR) 06/27/2000 for Vernalis Minimum Flows

/*
 In Cycle 6:
 The following code defines and meets the 1995 Water Quality Control Plan codified in D1641
 (WQCP) Vernalis February thru June minimum flows (excluding the pulse flow period Apr15-May15).

 The Vernalis minimum flow is a function of:
     1)  60-20-20 index (San Joaquin basin water year type)
     2)  Where is 2ppt isohaline (measured as 2.64 mmhos/cm surface salinity) is required to be
 If the day weighted average requirement at Roe, Chipps and Confluence is less than
 or equal to 74 km, X2 is required to be at or West of Chipps, i.e. <= 74 km

                    X2 Required to be        X2 Required to be at or
                    East of Chipps           West of Chips

 Release for the requirement is made from New Melones and may be restricted
 by a inputted limit on allocation of Stan water for this purpose.  See STAN_YR.TABLE
 The USBR 1997 two-year Interim Plan of Operations used the following allocation table:
 Water Supply   Annual
  Forecast     Allocation
   (TAF)         (TAF)
 -----------------------
     0.        0.
     1400.     0.
     2000.     0.

     3000.     1000.
     6000.     1000.

where the Water Supply Forecast was comprised of End-of-Feb New Melones storage in taf + forecasted inflow
to New Melones from Mar1 to Sep30 in taf.  Usually in modeling thus far, this "forecast" was with perfect foresight.
