! This code calculates the Stanislaus operations for fish and wildlife pulse flows
!########################################################################################
/*
The minimum fish and wildlife flows are determined using the New Melones forecast, NMforeast1.
This forecast determines an annual delivery requirement from a look-up table.  From the annual
delivery requirement another look-up table is used to determine the monthly requirements.
In April and May, a pulse flow requirement is also calculated, but the pulse flow only applies
during the last 16 days in April and the first 15 days in May.  The goal of the resulting monthly
requirement is to maintain a minimum fish and wildlife flow downstream of Goodwin Dam.  To ensure
a minimum flow, it is only necessary to impose this requirement on reaches C520 and C528
