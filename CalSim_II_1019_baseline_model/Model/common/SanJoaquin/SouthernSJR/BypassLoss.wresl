/*
Depletion representation in the Chowchilla/Eastside Bypass Structure:  (Brekke, 09/13/04)

This file checks whether Chowchilla Bypass is being operated for flood control.
In these instances, CALSIM assumes that any residual flows from the Chowchilla
and Fresno Rivers, along with flows being sent from the SJ Bifurcation through
the Chowchilla Bypass, will eventually pass through the Eastside Bypass and
into the San Joaquin River.  In other instance (i.e. when the Chowchilla Bypass,
or C605B, is empty, it is assumed that any flows coming from the Chowchilla and
Fresno Rivers will go underground prior to reaching the San Joaquin River (i.e. C587) is zero.

To represent this thought, a loss variable is introduced at node 587.  When their is flow
in C605B, then L587 is set at zero and Bypass depletions during flood operations are ignored.
When C605B is dry, then L587 is set at the summed value of all inflows to node 587, implying
that C587 will be zero.

/* Retrieve predefined Chowchilla Bypass "Status" variable.  These values were determined from
a CALSIM simulation where only results from Friant to the Bifurcation are considered.  If
input assumptions on Friant or James Bypass flood control operations are change, then this
"Status" variable must be recomputed.*/
