/*
Negative accretions at node 620 are defined separately as a demand in such a
way that there is no chance they'll pull water from storage.  

Merced has minimum flows at 561 and 564. If there is water in C561 above
minimum it should only be there to satisfy D562 or C564. Water in C564
above the minimum should only be there due to C20F, C20VAMP, or C20MIN.
