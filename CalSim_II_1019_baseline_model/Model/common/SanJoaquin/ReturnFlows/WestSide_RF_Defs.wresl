! Westside contract demands and percent return flow

/*
This code accomplishes 4 main objects:

1.  Defines individual annual contract amounts
2.  Sums individual annual contract amounts to define total contract demands
3.  Defines return flow segments as a percentage of each individual contract*
4.  Defines the monthly percentage return flow for each return flow segment

This file references several lookup tables; all variables are assigned
values from the tables. Those values are used to define the actual return
flows in the WestSideReturns.wresl file.

*Clarification: Some water users' return flows are not all returned to the
system in one general location. For example, returns from West Stanislaus WD
accumulate in 2 locations: the San Joaquin River at Maze and the San Joaquin
River above Maze. Thus, 2 return flow segments are created for that
individual contract; 55% of the flows are returned to Node 636 (at Maze) and
45% to Node 630 (above Maze). For the most part, however, one return flow
segment characterizes an individual contract.
