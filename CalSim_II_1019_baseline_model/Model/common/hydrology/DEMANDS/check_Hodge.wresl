!! This file is a Duplicate file of NimbusHistMinQ.wresl.  It is used here just to determine the Nimbus historic
!! (Modified D893) minflow.  The minflow is then compared against the Hodge Decision flow criteria to determine how much the
!! City of Sac will pull from the American River and Sacramento River.

!!!  Code for CVP(PROSIM) type lookup tables for minflow on the American below Nimbus.
!!!  Code for American River Operations based on "modified D-1400" per PROSIM file FWQ_B203.dat
!!!  Minflow below Nimbus(CP 41) is set according to a CVP Lookup Table that looks at
!!!  combinations Folsom storage and forecasted inflows and demands (see table below for trigger description).
!!!  The minflow must also meet Stability criteria.  The November - March minflows must be at least 80% of the
!!!  preceding month's flow.  If the preceding month's flow exceeds a stability limit, then the stability
!!!  criteria is ignored.
