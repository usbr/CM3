!The following code needs to be specified separate from the tables because it includes
!code dependant on the rule curve.  The rule curve needs to be computed after the total
!storage zones of S11 and S12 are defined.
!Until a new GenWresl is implemented, the following logic needs to be in this file and
!not in the GenWresl generated files.

define S11level3 {value CVPRuleCalc1}

goal S11Zone3 {S11_3 < max(0.0,S11level3 - S11level2)}
goal S11Zone4 {S11_4 < S11level4 - S11level3}
goal S11Zone5 {S11_5 < S11level5 - S11level4}

define S12level3 {value SWPRuleCalc1}

goal S12Zone3 {S12_3 < max(0.0,S12level3 - S12level2)}
goal S12Zone4 {S12_4 < S12level4 - S12level3}
goal S12Zone5 {S12_5 < S12level5 - S12level4}
