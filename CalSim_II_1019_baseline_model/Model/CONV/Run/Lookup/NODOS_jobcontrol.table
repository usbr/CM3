!                                   12 to combine the maximum of option 1 and 2,
!                               and 13 to combine the maximum of option 1 and 3)
!  2 - FlowSelect (value of 0 for no flow selections will be implemented
!                           1 for flow selections will be implemented w/ static Cottonwood flow targets
!                           2 for flow selections will be implemented w/ dynamic Cottonwood flow calculation
!  3 - AprMaySacRDivRedSwitch
!  4 - YoloAugmentSwitch
!  5 - ColdWaterReleases (value of 1 uses schedule defined in lookup table
!                                  2 uses new forecast technique)
!  6 - ColdStorTarg (Trinity and Shasta combined storage value to use as offramp on ERP flow actions at Shasta)

!                                     2 for 6 month 1,000 - 1,500 cfs tiered schedule)
!Switches to selectively turn on Misc features/controls (on=1, off=0)
! 10 - NewPipeOption (value of 0-1, 1 assumes 100% of new pipe, 0 assumes none, uses associated capacities defined below)
! 11 - NewPipeRerouted (make sure to set to zero if NODOS project not modeled)
!Specification of Local account operations settings
! 300 - DeadPoolLocal (Dead Storage pool implemented in local account - overrides NODOS.table local entry if exceeds)
! 301 - RiceDecompANN (Annual Rice Decomposition Demand for Local)
!Specification of SWP account operations settings
! 310 - S31_RuleCrv (S31 NODOSSWP Rule Curve Value - controls balancing with Oroville)
!Specification of CVP account operations settings
! 320 - CVPStorReserve (This is the maximum amount for which NODOS CVP will be included in CVP allocation decisions)
! 321 - ERPStorReserve (Reserve storage pool for ERP Flow targets and other non-consumptive operations associated with NODOS CVP account)
! 322 - S32_RuleCrv (S32 NODOSCVP Rule Curve Value - controls midlevel balancing with Shasta - typically 1/3 of NODOS CVP Max if Div Red and WS priority)
! 323 - CapCVPRiverRel (C32 limit)
! 324 - CapEXOPandLocalRel (C32B limit)
! 325 - L4StorReserve (This is the maximum amount that will be allocated to L4 in any year)
